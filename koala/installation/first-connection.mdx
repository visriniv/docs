## Quick Start

Get connected to Oracle Fusion Cloud in minutes with this step-by-step guide.

## Step 1: Open SQL Query Editor

First, open the Koala Data Explorer interface:

1. Open VS Code Command Palette:
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Mac: `Cmd+Shift+P`
2. Type: **"Koala Data Explorer: Open SQL Query Editor"**
3. Press Enter

The SQL Query Editor will open in a new tab.

## Step 2: Open Connection Manager

In the SQL Query Editor:

1. Look for the **Manage Connections** button in the top-left corner
2. Click the button to open the Connection Manager dialog

<Info>
  The Manage Connections button looks like a database icon with a gear.
</Info>

## Step 3: Add New Connection

In the Connection Manager dialog:

1. Click **Add Connection** button
2. Choose your authentication type:
   - **Basic Auth** (Free): Username and password
   - **OAuth PKCE** (Paid): Enterprise SSO
   - **SSO** (Paid): Single Sign-On

## Step 4: Configure Connection

### Basic Authentication (Free)

Fill in the connection details:

```json
{
  "name": "Production Oracle Fusion",
  "host": "your-instance.fa.ocs.oraclecloud.com",
  "username": "your.username@company.com",
  "password": "your-password"
}
```

**Field Descriptions**:
- **Name**: Friendly name for this connection (e.g., "Prod", "Test", "Dev")
- **Host**: Your Oracle Fusion instance URL (without https://)
- **Username**: Your Oracle Fusion username
- **Password**: Your Oracle Fusion password

<Warning>
  Do not include `https://` in the host field. Enter only the domain name.
</Warning>

### OAuth/SSO Authentication (Paid)

For OAuth PKCE authentication:

```json
{
  "name": "Production SSO",
  "host": "your-instance.fa.ocs.oraclecloud.com",
  "clientId": "your-client-id",
  "scope": "your-scope",
  "authorizationUrl": "https://idcs.oracle.com/oauth2/v1/authorize",
  "tokenUrl": "https://idcs.oracle.com/oauth2/v1/token"
}
```

**OAuth Configuration**:
- **Client ID**: OAuth application client ID
- **Scope**: Required OAuth scopes
- **Authorization URL**: IDCS authorization endpoint
- **Token URL**: IDCS token endpoint

<Note>
  Contact your Oracle Fusion administrator for OAuth configuration details.
</Note>

## Step 5: Test Connection

Before saving:

1. Click **Test Connection** button
2. Wait for the connection test to complete
3. Look for success message: "Connection successful!"

If the test fails, check:
- Network connectivity to Oracle Fusion
- Correct hostname (no typos)
- Valid credentials
- Firewall/proxy settings

## Step 6: Save Connection

Once the test passes:

1. Click **Save** button
2. Connection appears in your connections list
3. Click **Done** to close the dialog

## Step 7: Connect to Oracle Fusion

Back in the SQL Query Editor:

1. Find the connection dropdown in the query tab header
2. Select your newly created connection
3. Click the **Connect** button
4. Wait for "Connected" status

## Automatic deployment on first connection

Koala verifies and deploys required BIP catalog artifacts automatically when you connect.

- **Hash check**: Local artifacts are compared to the remote hash; mismatches trigger a redeploy.
- **Progress notifications**: Watch for deployment start, upload, and completion toasts.
- **Force redeploy**: Use the button in Managing Connections if you need to push a fresh copy manually.

<Note>
  Auto-deployment also runs on reconnect when the remote catalog hash changes.
</Note>

<Check>
  When connected successfully, you'll see:
  - Green "Connected" status
  - Data sources loading in the sidebar (Paid feature)
  - Ready to execute queries
</Check>

## Step 8: Run Your First Query

Try a simple query to verify everything works:

```sql
-- Get current user information
SELECT 
    USER_NAME,
    USER_GUID,
    CREATED_BY,
    CREATION_DATE
FROM 
    PER_USERS
WHERE 
    ROWNUM <= 10;
```

Press `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Enter` (Mac) to execute.

## Connection Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive names:
- ✅ "Production - Finance"
- ✅ "DEV Environment"
- ✅ "Test Instance - US"
- ❌ "Connection 1"
- ❌ "Oracle"

### Security Recommendations

1. **Never share credentials**: Each user should use their own account
2. **Use SSO when available**: More secure than basic auth
3. **Rotate passwords regularly**: Update connections after password changes
4. **Limit access**: Only connect to instances you need

### Multiple Environments

Organize connections by environment:

```
Production - Primary
Production - DR
Test - Integration
Test - UAT
Development - Sprint 1
Development - Sprint 2
```

## Common Connection URLs

### Oracle Fusion Cloud

```
# Production
your-prod.fa.ocs.oraclecloud.com

# Test
your-test.fa.ocs.oraclecloud.com

# Development
your-dev.fa.ocs.oraclecloud.com
```

### Regional Instances

```
# US Commercial
instance.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com

# EU Frankfurt
instance.fa.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com

# UK London
instance.fa.uk-london-1.oraclecloud.com
```

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

### "Connection Failed" Error

**Check these common causes**:

1. **Incorrect Host**:
   - Remove `https://` prefix
   - Verify no trailing slashes
   - Check for typos

2. **Invalid Credentials**:
   - Verify username format
   - Check password is current
   - Ensure account isn't locked

3. **Network Issues**:
   - Test Oracle Fusion access in browser
   - Check VPN connection if required
   - Verify firewall rules

### "Timeout" Error

Increase timeout in settings:

```json
{
  "koalaDataExplorer.timeout": 180000
}
```

### "Certificate" Error

For self-signed certificates:

```json
{
  "http.proxyStrictSSL": false
}
```

<Warning>
  Only disable SSL verification for development/test environments.
</Warning>

### Proxy Configuration

If behind a corporate proxy:

```json
{
  "http.proxy": "http://proxy.company.com:8080",
  "http.proxyAuthorization": null
}
```

## Managing Multiple Connections

### Switch Between Connections

1. Use the dropdown in the query tab
2. Select different connection
3. Click Connect

### Edit Existing Connections

1. Open Manage Connections
2. Click edit icon next to connection
3. Update details
4. Test and save

### Delete Connections

1. Open Manage Connections
2. Click delete icon
3. Confirm deletion

<Note>
  Deleting a connection doesn't affect saved queries or history.
</Note>
