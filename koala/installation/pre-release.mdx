## Overview

Koala Data Explorer offers pre-release versions through VS Code's pre-release extension system. These versions include the latest features and improvements before they're released to the general public.

<Note>
  Pre-release versions may contain experimental features and could be less stable than production releases. They're perfect for testing new functionality and providing feedback.
