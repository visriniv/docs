## Overview

This guide helps you diagnose and resolve performance issues when using Koala Data Explorer with Oracle Fusion Cloud.

## Slow Query Performance

### Identifying Slow Queries

**Symptoms:**
- Queries take long time to execute
- Timeout errors
- VS Code becomes unresponsive during query execution

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. **Check query execution time**: Monitor timing in results panel
2. **Compare similar queries**: See if specific queries are slower
3. **Test with row limits**: Add `WHERE ROWNUM <= 100` to test

### Common Causes of Slow Queries

#### Large Result Sets

**Problem:** Returning too many rows
```sql
-- Slow: No row limit
SELECT * FROM ap_invoices_all;

-- Better: With reasonable limit
SELECT * FROM ap_invoices_all WHERE ROWNUM <= 1000;
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Add row limits**: Always use `ROWNUM` or `FETCH FIRST`
2. **Filter data**: Use specific WHERE clauses
3. **Select specific columns**: Avoid `SELECT *`

#### Missing WHERE Clauses

**Problem:** Full table scans on large tables
```sql
-- Slow: Full table scan
SELECT * FROM per_all_people_f;

-- Better: Filtered query
SELECT * FROM per_all_people_f 
WHERE effective_end_date = DATE '4712-12-31'
AND ROWNUM <= 1000;
```

#### Inefficient Joins

**Problem:** Joining large tables without proper conditions
```sql
-- Slow: Cartesian product
SELECT e.*, d.*
FROM per_all_people_f e, hr_all_organization_units d;

-- Better: Proper join with conditions
SELECT e.person_number, d.name
FROM per_all_people_f e
JOIN per_all_assignments_m a ON e.person_id = a.person_id
JOIN hr_all_organization_units d ON a.organization_id = d.organization_id
WHERE e.effective_end_date = DATE '4712-12-31'
AND a.effective_end_date = DATE '4712-12-31'
AND ROWNUM <= 1000;
```

## Network Performance Issues

### Slow Connection to Oracle Fusion

**Symptoms:**
- Long delays before queries start executing
- Intermittent timeouts
- Slow authentication

**Causes:**
1. **Network latency**: Distance to Oracle Fusion servers
2. **VPN overhead**: Corporate VPN adding latency
3. **Bandwidth limitations**: Slow internet connection
4. **Proxy servers**: Corporate proxies adding delays

**Solutions:**
1. **Test network speed**: Use network speed tests
2. **Check VPN**: Try without VPN if possible
3. **Use wired connection**: Ethernet instead of WiFi
4. **Peak hours**: Avoid peak usage times

### DNS Resolution Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Initial connection delays
- Intermittent "host not found" errors

**Solutions:**
1. **Use IP addresses**: If DNS is slow, try IP address
2. **DNS cache**: Clear DNS cache on your machine
3. **Alternative DNS**: Try different DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1)

## VS Code Performance Issues

### High Memory Usage

**Symptoms:**
- VS Code becomes slow or unresponsive
- High memory usage in Task Manager
- System becomes sluggish

**Causes:**
1. **Large result sets**: Too much data loaded in memory
2. **Multiple query tabs**: Many tabs with results open
3. **Query history**: Large query history accumulation

**Solutions:**
1. **Clear results**: Close result tabs when done
2. **Limit query results**: Use smaller row limits
3. **Restart VS Code**: Periodically restart to clear memory
4. **Close unused tabs**: Keep only necessary tabs open

### Slow UI Response

**Symptoms:**
- Typing lag in query editor
- Slow scrolling through results
- Delayed button clicks

**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce result set size**: Display fewer rows
2. **Close large results**: Clear memory-intensive results
3. **Disable extensions**: Temporarily disable other VS Code extensions
4. **Check system resources**: Monitor CPU and memory usage

## Oracle Fusion Performance

### Database-Side Performance

**Common Oracle Issues:**
1. **Peak usage times**: High load during business hours
2. **Maintenance windows**: Scheduled maintenance affecting performance
3. **Resource contention**: Other users running heavy queries

**Solutions:**
1. **Off-peak usage**: Run queries during low-usage times
2. **Check announcements**: Monitor Oracle Fusion maintenance schedules
3. **Optimize queries**: Use efficient SQL patterns

### Query Optimization Techniques

#### Use Indexes Effectively

```sql
-- Good: Filter on indexed columns
SELECT * FROM ap_invoices_all 
WHERE invoice_date >= DATE '2024-01-01'
AND ROWNUM <= 1000;

-- Avoid: Functions on indexed columns
SELECT * FROM ap_invoices_all 
WHERE TO_CHAR(invoice_date, 'YYYY') = '2024';
```

#### Efficient Date Filtering

```sql
-- Efficient: Date range filtering
SELECT * FROM transactions
WHERE transaction_date BETWEEN DATE '2024-01-01' AND DATE '2024-12-31'
AND ROWNUM <= 1000;

-- Less efficient: Date functions
SELECT * FROM transactions
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date) = 2024;
```

## Data Export Performance

### Slow Export Operations

**Symptoms:**
- Export operations take very long
- Export failures due to timeouts
- Large file generation delays

**Solutions:**

#### For Large Datasets:
1. **Use CSV instead of Excel**: CSV is faster for large data
2. **Export in batches**: Break large exports into smaller chunks
3. **Filter before export**: Reduce data size with WHERE clauses

#### Excel Export Optimization:
```sql
-- For Excel export (10K row limit)
SELECT specific_columns
FROM your_table
WHERE filter_conditions
AND ROWNUM <= 10000;
```

#### CSV Export for Large Data:
```sql
-- For large CSV exports
SELECT specific_columns
FROM your_table
WHERE filter_conditions
AND ROWNUM <= 50000; -- Adjust based on needs
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Built-in Performance Tracking

**Available Metrics:**
- Query execution time (displayed in results)
- Row count returned
- Connection response time

**How to Use:**
1. **Monitor timing**: Check execution time for each query
2. **Compare performance**: Track changes over time
3. **Identify patterns**: Note which queries are consistently slow

### Performance Benchmarking

**Simple Benchmarks:**
```sql
-- Test connection speed
SELECT 1 FROM dual;

-- Test simple table access
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hr_all_organization_units;

-- Test filtered query
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM per_all_people_f 
WHERE effective_end_date = DATE '4712-12-31';
```

## System Resource Optimization

```sql
SELECT SYSDATE FROM dual;
```

**Small Table Test:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fnd_lookup_values WHERE ROWNUM <= 1;
```

**Filtered Query Test:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM hr_all_organization_units 
WHERE organization_id < 1000 
AND ROWNUM <= 100;
```

## Best Practices for Performance

### Query Writing Best Practices

1. **Always use row limits**: Protect against accidentally large results
2. **Filter early and often**: Use WHERE clauses to reduce data
3. **Select only needed columns**: Avoid SELECT *
4. **Use appropriate date ranges**: Don't query all historical data
5. **Test with small datasets first**: Verify query logic before scaling up

### Usage Patterns

1. **Plan your queries**: Think about what data you need before writing SQL
2. **Reuse successful patterns**: Save and reuse well-performing queries
3. **Monitor your usage**: Be aware of peak times and system load
4. **Batch similar work**: Group related queries together
5. **Clean up regularly**: Close unused tabs and clear old results

### Environment Considerations

1. **Development vs Production**: Performance may vary between environments
2. **Time zones**: Consider Oracle Fusion server time zone for peak usage
3. **Geographic location**: Distance from Oracle servers affects latency
4. **Corporate networks**: Internal networks may have different performance characteristics
