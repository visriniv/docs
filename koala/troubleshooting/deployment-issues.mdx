## Symptoms

- Repeated deployment prompts on connect
- "Hash mismatch" or "artifact missing" errors
- Catalog features unavailable after connection
- Deployment progress notification never completes

## Quick fixes

1. Click **Force Redeploy Catalog** in Managing Connections.
2. Reconnect and watch for the deployment progress notification.
3. Verify hash status shows "up to date" in the connection details.

## Common causes

- Remote catalog differs from local package (hash mismatch).
- Required artifacts were removed on the Oracle side.
- Previous upload was interrupted by network loss.
- Hash verification failed because the remote catalog could not be read.
- Version of the bundled package changed but remote hash stayed stale.

## Verification checklist

1. Confirm the hash shown in the connection details matches your last deployment time.
2. Check the Output channel for the `downloadObject` requests and their hashes.
3. If the hash is missing or mismatched, run **Force Redeploy Catalog**.
4. Reconnect and confirm the new hash is stored.

## Still seeing issues?

- Check network stability during uploads.
- Confirm you have rights to deploy BIP artifacts.
- Capture the output log and share with support for deeper analysis.
- Note the hash values shown in the Output channel; include them when opening a support ticket.
