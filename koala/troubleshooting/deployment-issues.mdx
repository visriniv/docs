## Symptoms

- Repeated deployment prompts on connect
- "Hash mismatch" or "artifact missing" errors
- Catalog features unavailable after connection

## Quick fixes

1. Click **Force Redeploy Catalog** in Managing Connections.
2. Reconnect and watch for the deployment progress notification.
3. Verify hash status shows "up to date" in the connection details.

## Common causes

- Remote catalog differs from local package (hash mismatch).
- Required artifacts were removed on the Oracle side.
- Previous upload was interrupted by network loss.

## Still seeing issues?

- Check network stability during uploads.
- Confirm you have rights to deploy BIP artifacts.
- Capture the output log and share with support for deeper analysis.
