## Overview

Optimize execution speed, memory, and network efficiency with a few targeted settings.

## Recommended settings

```json
{
  "koalaDataExplorer.maxRows": 1000,
  "koalaDataExplorer.timeout": 120000,
  "koala.execution.fetchSize": 200,
  "koala.execution.stopOnError": true
}
```

- **Max Rows**: Applies a ROWNUM guard server-side to prevent runaway result sets.
- **Timeout**: Stops long-running requests that exceed your SLA.
- **Fetch size**: Balances memory and network calls when streaming results.

## Benchmarks

- Compression reduces large SQL payload size by ~60% on average.
- Tab isolation keeps memory stable when multiple queries run concurrently.
- Auto column width and virtual scrolling reduce render time for wide datasets.

## Optimization tips

- Prefer targeted column lists instead of `SELECT *`.
- Apply WHERE filters early; ROWNUM limits are enforced even with filters present.
- Use bind variables to improve plan reuse.
