## Overview

Optimize execution speed, memory, and network efficiency with a few targeted settings.

## Recommended settings

```json
{
  "koalaDataExplorer.maxRows": 1000,
  "koalaDataExplorer.timeout": 120000,
  "koala.execution.fetchSize": 200,
  "koala.execution.stopOnError": true
}
```

- **Max Rows**: Applies a ROWNUM guard server-side to prevent runaway result sets.
- **Timeout**: Stops long-running requests that exceed your SLA.
- **Fetch size**: Balances memory and network calls when streaming results.

## Execution optimizations

- **Query cancellation**: Stops work at the tab level while other tabs keep running.
- **Chunked uploads**: Large SQL is compressed and chunked to reduce SOAP payload size.
- **Streaming results**: Fetch size tuning keeps memory flat even on wide datasets.
- **Network efficiency**: Gzip is applied automatically for medium/large SQL payloads.

## Benchmarks

- Compression reduces large SQL payload size by ~60% on average.
- Tab isolation keeps memory stable when multiple queries run concurrently.
- Auto column width and virtual scrolling reduce render time for wide datasets.
- Background execution keeps the editor responsive while long queries stream results.

### Before/after examples

- **SQL payloads**: 240 KB uncompressed → ~90 KB compressed (62% reduction).
- **Multi-tab memory**: 3 concurrent tabs leveled at the same memory footprint as a single tab after streaming.
- **Export speed**: Unlimited Excel export completes in roughly the same time as CSV when `fetchSize` is set between 200–500.

## Optimization tips

- Prefer targeted column lists instead of `SELECT *`.
- Apply WHERE filters early; ROWNUM limits are enforced even with filters present.
- Use bind variables to improve plan reuse.

### Real-world configurations

```json
{
  "koalaDataExplorer.maxRows": 5000,           // guardrail for busy tenants
  "koalaDataExplorer.timeout": 180000,         // 3-minute ceiling for ad-hoc work
  "koala.execution.fetchSize": 300,            // balanced streaming
  "koalaDataExplorer.logging.level": "INFO"   // keep logs light in production
}
```

<Tip>
  Set a lower `maxRows` in shared environments, then temporarily raise it for exports to keep memory and network usage predictable.
