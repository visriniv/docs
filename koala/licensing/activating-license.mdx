## Overview

After your 7-day free trial ends and you decide to continue with Koala Data Explorer, you'll need to activate your paid license. This guide walks you through the activation process.

## Automatic Activation

In most cases, your license activates automatically:

1. **Trial ends** after 7 days
2. **Payment processed** via LemonSqueezy
3. **License activated** automatically in VS Code
4. **Full features unlocked** immediately

You should see a notification in VS Code confirming your license activation.

## Manual Activation

If automatic activation doesn't work, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Locate Your License Key

1. **Check your email** for the purchase confirmation
2. **Visit LemonSqueezy portal**: [My Orders](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/my-orders/)
3. **Find your order** and copy the license key

### Step 2: Enter License in Extension

1. **Open Koala Data Explorer** in VS Code
2. **Click the Settings gear** in the extension toolbar
3. **Select "License Settings"**
4. **Paste your license key** in the provided field
5. **Click "Activate License"**

### Step 3: Verify Activation

After activation, you should see:
- ✅ **License status**: "Active" in settings
