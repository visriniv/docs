## Overview

Use in-grid search to quickly locate values without exporting data.

## Start a search

1. Click inside the results grid.
2. Press `Ctrl+F` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+F` (Mac).
3. The search bar appears above the grid with the first match highlighted.

## Navigate matches

- **Next/Previous**: Use the arrows in the search bar or press `Enter` / `Shift+Enter`.
- **Highlighting**: All matches are highlighted; the active match stays focused as you navigate.
- **Selection aware**: Searches the current results set, respecting applied filters and sorting.

## Tips

- Use column sorting first to cluster similar values before searching.
- Combine with row selection to export only the rows that match.
