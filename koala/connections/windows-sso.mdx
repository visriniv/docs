## Overview

Koala Data Explorer supports connecting to Oracle Fusion Cloud using your organization's existing SAML-based SSO. This is different from OAuth PKCE authentication - it works directly with Oracle Fusion's built-in SSO without requiring additional setup.

<Note>
  SSO authentication requires a paid license and is currently available only on Windows. See [Free vs Paid Features](/koala/licensing/free-vs-paid) for more information.
</Note>

## Why Use SSO?

### Simple Setup
- **No OAuth configuration required**: Works with your existing Oracle Fusion SSO
- **No administrator setup**: Uses SSO already configured in Oracle Fusion
- **One-click authentication**: Just enter your Oracle URL and connect

### Enterprise Integration
- **Uses your existing SSO**: Works with whatever SSO method your organization uses
- **Multi-factor authentication**: Supports MFA when configured in your SSO
- **Familiar experience**: Same login process you use for Oracle Fusion web portal

## Requirements

- **Windows 10/11**: Currently Windows-only
- **Runtime dependencies**: Extension automatically downloads required components when needed

## Setting Up SSO

### Step 1: Create SSO Connection

1. **Open Connection Manager**: Click "Manage Connections" in the query editor
2. **Add new connection**: Click "Add Connection"
3. **Select authentication type**: Choose "SSO - Windows Only"
4. **Enter connection details**:
   - **Connection Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Production SSO")
   - **Host URL**: Your Oracle Fusion Cloud instance URL
5. **Save connection**: Click "Save"

### Step 2: Connect

1. **Select your SSO connection** from the dropdown
2. **Click Connect**: The extension handles the rest
3. **Complete SSO login**: Use your normal Oracle Fusion login process
4. **Start querying**: You're connected and ready to query data

<Note>
  On first use, the extension may download required components (this happens automatically).
</Note>

## How It Works

SSO authentication connects you to Oracle Fusion using the same login process you use in your web browser. The extension opens a secure login window where you complete your organization's SSO process.

## BIP Catalog Setup

Like OAuth PKCE connections, SSO connections require manual BIP catalog deployment:

1. **Click "Deploy to BIP"** in the query editor after connecting
2. **Download the catalog file** 
3. **Send to your Oracle administrator** for deployment to `/Custom/Koala/`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Runtime components missing"**
- Accept the download prompt when shown
- Restart VS Code after installation

**"SSO dialog won't open"**
- Restart VS Code
- Check with IT if antivirus software is blocking the connection

**"Authentication timeout"**
- Verify SSO is working in your regular browser
- Contact your Oracle administrator if SSO login fails

## When to Use SSO vs OAuth PKCE

### Use SSO When:
- Your team uses Windows computers
- You want the simplest setup (no OAuth configuration needed)
- Your Oracle Fusion already has SSO configured

### Use OAuth PKCE When:
- You need cross-platform support (Mac/Linux users)
- Your organization requires OAuth-based authentication
- You need centralized OAuth management
