## Overview

Koala Data Explorer provides multiple ways to execute SQL queries against your Oracle Fusion Cloud data. This guide covers query execution methods, options, and best practices.

## Execution Methods

### Quick Execute

The fastest way to run queries:

1. **Keyboard Shortcut**: `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Enter` (Mac)
2. **Button**: Click the green "Run" button in the editor toolbar
3. **Context Menu**: Right-click → "Execute Query"

### Execute Selection

Run only selected SQL:

1. Select the SQL text you want to run
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` or click "Run Selection"
3. Only the selected text will be executed

<Tip>
  This is useful when you have multiple queries in one editor and want to run them individually.
</Tip>

### Execute Current Statement

Automatically detect and run the statement at cursor position:

1. Place cursor anywhere in a SQL statement
2. Press `Alt+Enter`
3. Koala will identify statement boundaries and execute

## Query Execution Options

### Execution Settings

Configure how queries are executed:

```json
{
  "koala.execution.timeout": 30000,
  "koala.execution.fetchSize": 100,
  "koala.execution.maxRows": 1000,
  "koala.execution.stopOnError": true
}
```

### Row Limits

Control how many rows are returned:

- **Free Version**: Maximum 50 rows per query
- **Paid Version**: Configurable, unlimited rows

Set custom limits:
1. Click the settings icon in query editor
2. Adjust "Max Rows" value
3. Use `FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY` in SQL for precise control

### Timeout Configuration

Prevent long-running queries:

- Default timeout: 30 seconds
- Maximum timeout: 5 minutes
- Configure per-query or globally

To set query-specific timeout:
```sql
-- @timeout: 60000
SELECT * FROM large_table;
```

## Multi-Statement Execution

### Sequential Execution (Paid)

Execute multiple statements in order:

```sql
-- Statement 1
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;

-- Statement 2
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department_id;

-- Statement 3
SELECT * FROM departments;
```

Press `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` to run all statements sequentially.

### Multi-Statement Execution

When executing multiple statements:
- Each statement executes sequentially
- Execution stops on first error
- Results shown for each completed statement

## Query Parameters

### Bind Variables

Use bind variables for dynamic queries:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE department_id = :dept_id
AND hire_date > :start_date;
```

When executed, Koala will prompt for parameter values in an input dialog.

## Execution Status

### Progress Indicators

Monitor query execution:

- **Spinner**: Query is running
- **Progress Bar**: Shows fetch progress for large results
- **Timer**: Displays elapsed time
- **Cancel Button**: Stops the active tab's query without affecting others

### Status Messages

Execution feedback appears in:

- Status bar (brief summary)
- Output panel (detailed logs)
- Results panel (row count, execution time)

## Cancel Query Execution

### How to Cancel

Stop a running query:

1. Click the "Cancel" button in the toolbar
2. Press `Ctrl+Alt+C`
3. Click "Stop" in the progress notification

### What Happens on Cancel

- Query execution stops on the server for the active tab only
- Partial results may be returned
- Connection remains active
- Transaction is rolled back (if applicable)
- Other tabs continue running their own queries

<Warning>
  Some queries may continue running on the Oracle server even after cancellation. Check with your DBA if concerned about long-running queries.
</Warning>

## Tab isolation and background execution

- Each tab has an isolated execution context; cancelling one tab does not interrupt others.
- You can switch tabs while a query runs in the background; status and cancel remain available from the originating tab.
- Switching connections within a tab will cancel any in-flight query for that tab.

## Execution History

### View Recent Queries

Access query history:

1. Press `Ctrl+H` or click History icon
2. Browse executed queries
3. Click to reload any query
4. Filter by date, status, or connection

### History Features

- **Free Version**: Last 50 queries
- **Paid Version**: Last 500 queries with search

Each history entry includes:
- SQL text
- Execution time
- Row count
- Timestamp
- Connection used

## Performance Optimization

### Query Performance Tips

1. **Use Indexes**: Include indexed columns in WHERE clauses
2. **Limit Rows**: Add FETCH FIRST or ROWNUM conditions
3. **Select Specific Columns**: Avoid SELECT *
4. **Use Bind Variables**: Improve query plan caching

### Query Performance

Monitor query performance:
- Execution time displayed in results
- Row count shown
- Timeout warnings if query runs long

## Error Handling

### Common Execution Errors

#### ORA-00942: Table or view does not exist
- Verify table name and schema
- Check user permissions
- Ensure correct connection

#### ORA-00936: Missing expression
- Check SQL syntax
- Verify all columns exist
- Review JOIN conditions

#### ORA-01017: Invalid username/password
- Re-authenticate connection
- Update stored credentials
- Check account status

### Error Display

Errors appear in:
- **Inline**: Red squiggly lines in editor
- **Problems Panel**: Detailed error list
- **Output Panel**: Full error stack trace

## Export Results

After query execution, you can export results:

1. Click Export button in results toolbar
2. Choose format (CSV, JSON, or Excel for paid version)
3. Select save location
4. Results are saved to file

## Best Practices

### Before Execution

1. Review query for errors
2. Estimate result size
3. Consider adding row limits
4. Use explain plan for complex queries

### During Execution

1. Monitor progress for long queries
2. Be ready to cancel if needed
3. Watch for timeout warnings
4. Check connection stability

### After Execution

1. Verify result accuracy
2. Check execution time
3. Save useful queries
4. Export important results
