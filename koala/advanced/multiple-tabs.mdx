## Overview

Koala Data Explorer supports multiple query tabs, allowing you to work on several SQL queries simultaneously. This feature improves productivity by letting you switch between different queries without losing your work.

<Note>
  Multiple tabs are available in the paid version of Koala Data Explorer. The free version supports only one active tab.

## Working with Tabs

### Creating New Tabs

Create additional query tabs by clicking the **+** button in the tab bar. Each new tab provides a fresh query editor with its own:
- SQL editor space
- Independent connection (can connect to different databases)
- Results area
- Execution context

### Tab Navigation

Switch between tabs by:
- **Click tabs**: Click on any tab name to switch to it
- **Tab indicators**: Visual cues show tab status

### Tab Management

Manage your open tabs:

- **Close tabs**: Click the "×" on any tab 
- **Tab titles**: Tabs show query content preview or file names
- **Unsaved changes**: Indicated by a dot (●) in tab title

## Tab Features

### Independent Contexts

Each tab maintains its own:
- **Query content**: Separate SQL editor with independent content
- **Connection**: Each tab can connect to different databases or use different connections
- **Results display**: Separate results panel showing results only for that tab's queries
- **File association**: Tabs can be linked to saved .sql files

### Tab States

Visual indicators show tab status:
- **Clean tabs**: No unsaved changes
- **Modified tabs**: Dot (●) indicator for unsaved changes
- **File path**: Tab title shows file path when query is saved

## Productivity Features

Multiple tabs enable efficient workflow:

1. **Compare results**: Run different queries and compare results side-by-side
2. **Reference data**: Keep lookup queries open in separate tabs
3. **Multi-environment work**: Connect different tabs to different Oracle Fusion environments
4. **Organized development**: Separate complex analysis into multiple focused queries

## Best Practices

### Effective Tab Usage

1. **Organize by purpose**: Use different tabs for different types of queries
2. **Save frequently**: Use `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S` to save your work in each tab
3. **Close when finished**: Click the × to close tabs you no longer need
4. **Use descriptive content**: Start queries with meaningful SQL comments so tab titles are clear

### Multi-Environment Workflow

- **Production queries**: Keep production environment queries in one tab
- **Development testing**: Use separate tabs for development environment
- **Reference queries**: Maintain lookup or reference queries in dedicated tabs
- **Comparison analysis**: Use multiple tabs to compare different approaches to the same problem

## File Management with Tabs

### Saving Tab Content

- **Save individual tabs**: Each tab can be saved as a separate .sql file
- **File associations**: When saved, the tab title shows the file path
- **Drag and drop**: Open existing .sql files by dragging them into the editor (creates new tabs)

### Tab Indicators

- **Dot (●)**: Indicates unsaved changes in the tab
- **File path**: Shows in tab title when query is saved to file
- **Query preview**: Shows first line of SQL content when not saved to file
