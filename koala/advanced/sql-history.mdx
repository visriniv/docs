## Overview

Koala Data Explorer automatically tracks your query history, allowing you to easily recall and reuse previously executed SQL statements. This feature helps you build on previous work and maintain a record of your database interactions.

## Accessing Query History

### Open History Panel

Access your query history:

1. Press `Ctrl+H` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+H` (Mac)
2. Or click the History icon in the toolbar
3. History panel opens showing recent queries

### History Location

Query history appears in:
- **Dedicated history panel**: Full query text and execution details
- **Quick access**: Recent queries in dropdown menus
- **Search functionality**: Find specific queries

## History Features

### What's Stored

Each history entry includes:
- **Complete SQL text**: Full query as executed
- **Execution timestamp**: When the query was run
- **Execution time**: How long the query took
- **Row count**: Number of rows returned
- **Connection used**: Which database connection
- **Success/failure status**: Whether query completed successfully

### History Limits

Query history storage limits:
- **Free version**: Last 50 executed queries
- **Paid version**: Last 500 executed queries

Older queries are automatically removed when limits are reached.

## Using History

### Recall Previous Queries

To reuse a query from history:

1. Open the history panel (`Ctrl+H`)
2. Browse through your previous queries
3. Click on any query to load it into the editor
4. Modify as needed and execute

### History Search

Find specific queries:
- Type in the search box to filter by query content
- Search looks through SQL text and table names
- Results update as you type

### Quick Navigation

Navigate through history:
- **Most recent first**: Newest queries at the top
- **Chronological order**: Easy to find recent work
- **Date grouping**: Queries grouped by day (paid version)

## History Management

### Automatic Cleanup

History is automatically managed:
- **Persistent storage**: Survives VS Code restarts
- **Automatic pruning**: Old queries removed when limit reached
- **Error handling**: Failed queries also stored for reference

### Manual Management

You can manually manage history:
- **Clear all history**: Remove all stored queries
- **Delete specific entries**: Remove individual queries
- **Export history**: Save queries to file (paid version)

## Working with History Entries

### Query Details

Each history entry shows:
- **SQL preview**: First few lines of the query
- **Timestamp**: Exact execution time
- **Performance**: Execution duration
- **Results**: Row count or error message

### Context Actions

Right-click on history entries for options:
- **Load query**: Copy to current editor
- **Copy SQL**: Copy query text to clipboard
- **Delete entry**: Remove from history
- **View details**: See full execution information

## Search and Filter

### Search Functionality

Find queries quickly:
- **Text search**: Search within SQL content
- **Table search**: Find queries using specific tables
- **Date range**: Filter by execution date (paid version)

### Filter Options

Filter history by:
- **Success/failure**: Show only successful or failed queries
- **Connection**: Queries from specific databases
- **Date range**: Recent queries or specific time periods

## Best Practices

### Organizing Queries

Make the most of query history:

1. **Use descriptive comments**: Add comments to important queries
2. **Test queries first**: Build up complex queries incrementally
3. **Save important queries**: Copy critical queries to files
4. **Regular cleanup**: Clear history periodically if needed

### Development Workflow

Effective use of history:
1. **Iterative development**: Build on previous query attempts
2. **Error learning**: Review failed queries to avoid mistakes
3. **Pattern reuse**: Find similar queries for new requirements
4. **Performance comparison**: Compare execution times

## History Settings

### Configuration Options

Configure history behavior through VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "koalaDataExplorer.history.maxEntries": 50,
  "koalaDataExplorer.history.searchEnabled": true,
  "koalaDataExplorer.history.groupByDate": false
}
```

### Privacy Settings

Control what's stored:
- **Query text**: Full SQL statements
- **Parameter values**: Bind variable values (if any)
- **Results metadata**: Row counts and timing
- **Error details**: Failure reasons

## Integration Features

### Parameter History

For queries with bind variables:
- **Parameter values**: Previous values remembered
- **Parameter suggestions**: Auto-suggest based on history
- **Parameter patterns**: Common value combinations

### Export Integration

History works with exports:
- **Export queries**: Save history entries to files
- **Import patterns**: Use history for new query development
- **Documentation**: Generate query documentation from history

## Troubleshooting

### History Not Saving

If history isn't working:
1. **Check settings**: Verify history is enabled
2. **Storage permissions**: Ensure VS Code can write to workspace
3. **Memory limits**: Check if storage quota exceeded
4. **Restart extension**: Reload Koala Data Explorer

### Performance Issues

If history is slow:
1. **Large history**: Clear old entries
2. **Complex queries**: Large SQL statements may slow search
3. **Search optimization**: Use specific search terms
4. **Limit results**: Reduce history display size

### Missing Queries

If queries don't appear in history:
1. **Execution status**: Only completed executions are stored
2. **Connection issues**: Failed connections may not save
3. **Storage errors**: Check for storage problems
4. **Manual execution**: Only manual queries stored (not automated)
