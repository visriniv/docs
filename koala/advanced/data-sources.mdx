<Note>
  Data Sources explorer is available in the paid version of Koala Data Explorer.
</Note>

## Accessing Data Sources

### Opening the Explorer

Access the Data Sources explorer:

1. Click the Koala icon in VS Code Activity Bar
2. Expand the "Data Sources" section
3. Explorer appears in the sidebar showing your schema structure

### Auto-refresh

The explorer automatically refreshes when you connect to a database, loading the available schemas, tables, and views.

## Schema Structure

### What You'll See

The explorer shows:

```
📁 Connection Name
├── 📊 Schema1
│   ├── 📋 Tables
│   │   ├── EMPLOYEES
│   │   ├── DEPARTMENTS
│   │   └── JOBS
│   └── 👁️ Views
│       ├── EMP_DETAILS_VIEW
│       └── DEPARTMENT_VIEW
└── 📊 Schema2
```

### Schema Information

For each schema you can see:
- **Schema name**: Database schema identifier
- **Tables**: Regular database tables
- **Views**: Database views and materialized views
- **Object count**: Number of objects in each category

## Exploring Tables and Views

### Table Information

When you expand a table, you can see:
- **Table name**: Database table name
- **Basic structure**: Available for browsing

### Quick Actions

Right-click on any table or view for options:
- **Generate SELECT**: Creates a basic SELECT statement
- **Copy Name**: Copies table/view name to clipboard

### Drag and Drop

You can drag table names from the explorer directly into your query editor to quickly add them to your SQL.

## Search Functionality

### Finding Objects

Use the search box in the Data Sources panel to:
- Search for table names
- Find views by name
- Locate specific database objects quickly

The search is case-insensitive and searches across all visible schemas.

## Working with Schemas

### Available Schemas

The explorer shows schemas that:
- You have access to query
- Contain tables or views you can SELECT from
- Are part of your Oracle Fusion environment

### Schema Access

Only schemas and objects you have SELECT permissions for will appear in the explorer. This respects your database security settings.

## Favorites

### Bookmark Important Tables

Mark frequently used tables as favorites:
1. Right-click on a table
2. Select "Add to Favorites"
3. Favorites appear at the top for quick access

This helps you quickly find the tables you use most often.

## Performance and Refreshing

### Auto-refresh Settings

The Data Sources explorer can be configured to:
- Automatically refresh when connecting
- Update schema information periodically
- Refresh manually when needed

### Manual Refresh

To manually refresh the schema information:
1. Right-click in the Data Sources panel
2. Select "Refresh"
3. Schema information updates with current database state

## Troubleshooting

### Schema Not Showing

If expected schemas don't appear:
1. **Check permissions**: Ensure you have SELECT access
2. **Verify connection**: Confirm you're connected to the right instance
3. **Refresh manually**: Try refreshing the data sources
4. **Contact DBA**: May need additional database permissions

### Slow Loading

If the Data Sources panel loads slowly:
1. **Network latency**: Check connection to Oracle Fusion
2. **Large schemas**: Many objects can slow loading
3. **Permissions**: Complex permission structures may impact performance

## Best Practices

### Organization

To make the most of Data Sources:
1. **Use favorites**: Bookmark your most-used tables
2. **Descriptive queries**: Use the generated SELECT as starting points
3. **Explore gradually**: Start with familiar schemas

### Security

Remember that:
- Only accessible objects are shown
- Respect data sensitivity
- Follow your organization's data access policies

## Integration with Queries

### Generated SQL

When you use "Generate SELECT" from the context menu:
- Basic SELECT statement is created
- Includes ROWNUM limit for safety
- Ready to execute or modify

### Query Building

Use the Data Sources explorer to:
1. **Discover tables**: Find relevant data sources
2. **Build joins**: Identify related tables
3. **Understand structure**: See what data is available

## Settings

### Configure Data Sources

You can configure the Data Sources behavior through VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "koalaDataExplorer.autoRefreshDataSources": true,
  "koalaDataExplorer.maxRows": 1000
}
```

## Limitations

### Current Limitations

The Data Sources explorer:
- Shows basic schema structure
- Provides table and view browsing
- Offers simple search functionality
- Includes favorites management

### Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Column details view
- Relationship information
- Enhanced search capabilities
- Additional metadata display
