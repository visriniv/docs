## How It Works

- Koala checks for updates on launch and every four hours.
- When a new build is ready, a slim banner appears with **Restart & Update** and **Later** options.
- Clicking **Restart & Update** installs the downloaded update and relaunches the app.

## Manual Updates

- Open the profile menu → **About Koala Studio** to see your version.
- Download the latest DMG/MSI from the Koala portal if you prefer manual installs.

## Release Cadence

- Major features ship quarterly, matching the VS Code extension.
- Critical fixes can appear between quarters; the banner highlights them the same way.

## Troubleshooting

- If the banner reappears after updating, reinstall from the portal to ensure files aren’t locked by antivirus tools.
- Air-gapped environments should disable auto-update via the settings file and rely on manual installs instead.
