## Creating & Managing Tabs

- `Ctrl/Cmd+N` or the **+** button creates a tab.
- Drag tabs to reorder them; a blue indicator shows the drop target.
- Right-click a tab for **Duplicate**, **Close Others**, or **Move to New Window** (forthcoming).

## Per-Tab State

- Each tab keeps its own connection, SQL text, history, and result cache.
- Switching connections in one tab does not affect others.
- Tab metadata is stored on disk so Koala restores your workspace exactly as you left it.

## Tips

- Keep dedicated tabs for production vs. sandbox to avoid mistakes.
- Duplicate a tab before experimenting so you always have the original SQL handy.
