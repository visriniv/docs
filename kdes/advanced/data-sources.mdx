## What You Can See

- Oracle Fusion subject areas, folders, and columns.
- BI Publisher data models (where permissions allow).
- Recently used tables/views for quick access.

## Using the Explorer

1. Click the database icon in the left rail to open the explorer.
2. Choose your connection from the dropdown.
3. Expand folders to view available tables/columns.
4. Click a column to copy its name into your clipboard or insert it into the active editor tab.

## Filters & Search

- Use the search bar to find objects by name.
- Toggle “Show only favorites” to view starred tables.

## Notes

- The explorer reflects your Oracle privileges; if you don’t see a schema, request access from your admin.
- Data isn’t queried until you run SQL—browsing metadata doesn’t incur heavy database load.
