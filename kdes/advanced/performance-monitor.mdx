## What It Shows

- Execution time for each statement.
- Rows returned vs. rows scanned (when Oracle provides stats).
- Client-side render time (how long the grid took to display data).

## Using the Monitor

- After running a query, open the **Performance** tab in the results pane.
- Toggle **Show timeline** to see how long each phase (prepare, fetch, render) took.
- Use the info to decide whether you need indexes, filters, or smaller result sets.

## Alerts

- Koala flags queries that run longer than your configured threshold (default 30 seconds) and suggests options:
  - Cancel the query
  - Export instead of rendering
  - Refine filters

## Tips

- Combine with SQL History to compare performance over time.
- Export the performance log (JSON) when filing support tickets so admins can analyze slow statements.
