## Accessing History

- Click the clock icon in the left explorer or press `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+H`.
- Use the right-rail History panel to see per-tab history if you prefer inline access.

## Features

- Stores up to 500 entries per user (mirrors your license tier).
- Each entry shows timestamp, connection, row count, and execution time.
- Click **Insert** to copy the query into a new tab, or **Run** to execute immediately with the same connection.

## Filters

- Filter by connection, tab name, or keyword.
- Use the date range picker to narrow history to specific windows (e.g., “last week”).

## Cleanup

- Clear individual entries via the **···** menu.
- Use **Clear History** to wipe everything (helpful before sharing screenshots or handing off the machine).

History syncs via Supabase, so you’ll see the same list on every device signed into your Koala account.
