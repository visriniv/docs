## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Area | KDEE (VS Code) | KDES (Native Desktop) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Distribution | VS Code Marketplace extension | Electron Forge installers (DMG/EXE, optional Linux) |
| Authentication | VS Code account context, SecretStorage | Supabase auth + native WebView2 helper for Oracle SSO |
| Storage | VS Code `globalState` + SecretStorage | File system data lake (`tabs/`, `results/`, `session/`) backed by Supabase |
| UI Surface | Webview inside VS Code | Full-screen React app with native menus and multi-window controls |
| Connection Portability | VS Code sync or manual JSON | Encrypted `.kdex` export/import plus Supabase sync roadmap |
| Updates | Marketplace auto-updates | In-app banner powered by `autoUpdater` + BTSS-hosted feeds |

## How to Use This Table

- Anchor it on the Studio landing page so readers understand why both surfaces exist.
- Link back to these differences whenever Mintlify cross-references KDEE features that behave slightly differently on desktop.
- Reinforce that KDES complements, rather than replaces, the extension—users can pick whichever workflow fits their policy constraints.
