## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Area | KDEE (VS Code) | KDES (Native Desktop) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| How you install | From the VS Code Marketplace | Download a signed DMG/MSI installer |
| Where it runs | Inside VS Code (as an extension) | Stand-alone window with native menus |
| Authentication | No Koala account required (VS Code SecretStorage only) | Requires Koala Cloud sign-in plus Windows SSO helper |
| Local storage | VS Code global state & secrets | Dedicated Koala folder with tab/results caches |
| Sharing connections | VS Code Settings Sync or export/import | Encrypted `.kdex` today, automatic sync coming |
| Updates | Managed by VS Code | Download latest DMG/MSI from Koala portal |

## Choosing the Right Surface

- Stay on KDEE if your team already lives inside VS Code or extensions are easier to deploy.
- Pick KDES when you need native clipboard/file access, richer OS integration, or a self-contained installer for locked-down environments.
- Mix and match—both apps has similar features and connections can be exported and imported across apps
