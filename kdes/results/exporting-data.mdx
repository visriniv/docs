## Export Options

- **CSV** – great for spreadsheets or lightweight sharing.
- **JSON** – preserves nested structures if your query returns JSON payloads.
- Access both via the **Export** dropdown above the grid.

## Partial vs Full Exports

- By default Koala exports the entire result set, fetching additional pages automatically.
- Select **Export current page only** from the dropdown if you only need what’s visible.

## File Destinations

- Files save to your system download folder.
- Koala names files using the tab name plus a timestamp so they’re easy to track.

## Tips

- Keep an eye on disk space—large exports can produce multi-gigabyte files.
- Use filters or adjust your SQL if you only need a subset to reduce export time.
