## Quick Search

- Click anywhere in the grid and press `Ctrl/Cmd+F`.
- A search bar appears above the grid—type text to highlight matching cells on the current page.
- Hit `Enter`/`Shift+Enter` to cycle through matches.

## Column-Specific Search

- Use the filter row beneath the column headers to limit results to cells containing certain strings.
- Supports partial matches by default; wrap in quotes for exact matches.

## Jump to Row

- Use the row number box (bottom-left of the grid) to jump directly to a specific row index on the current page.

Remember that in-grid search operates on the loaded page; navigate to other pages if the data you need is further down the result set.
