## Sorting

- Click a column header to sort ascending; click again for descending; a third click clears sorting.
- Multi-sort by holding `Shift` and clicking additional columns.
- Sorting happens client-side, so there’s no extra round-trip to Oracle.

## Filtering

- Use the inline filter row (toggle via the funnel icon) to type conditions for each column.
- Text columns support contains/equals comparisons; numeric columns support equals/greater/less-than.
- Clear filters with the **Reset Filters** button above the grid.

## Column Search

- Press `Ctrl/Cmd+F` while focused in the grid to search the current page.
- For global search across pages, rerun the query with your desired `WHERE` clauses or use the in-grid filter row to narrow results.

These tools let you refine data on the fly while keeping the original query results intact.
