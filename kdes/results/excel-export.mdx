## Why Excel Export?

Some teams require perfectly formatted `.xlsx` files with headers, data types, and multiple sheets. Koala Studio uses the same exporter as the VS Code extension, so your downstream workflows stay consistent.

## Steps

1. Run your query.
2. Click **Export** → **Excel (.xlsx)**.
3. Choose whether to export the entire result set or just the current page.
4. Pick a save location (defaults to Downloads) and confirm.

## What’s Included

- Column headers exactly as displayed in the grid.
- Data types preserved (dates, numbers, text) when possible.
- Pagination is transparent; Koala fetches all pages before writing the file.

## Tips

- For multi-sheet workbooks, export each query to a separate Excel file, then merge them in Excel.
- If Excel flags the file as coming from the internet, right-click → **Properties** → **Unblock** before opening on Windows.
