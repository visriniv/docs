## View License Status

- Profile avatar → **License** shows the current key, plan, and renewal date.
- Click **Manage in portal** to open the Lemon Squeezy customer portal (same as KDEE).

## Deactivate a Machine

1. In Koala, go to **Profile → License**.
2. Click **Deactivate** to free the seat.
3. Restart Koala or close the app; the license detaches from that device.

Use this when switching laptops or before re-imaging a device.

## Update Billing

- In the customer portal you can update payment methods, download invoices, or change plan tiers.
- All changes sync back to Koala automatically—no new key required.

## Lost Keys

- Retrieve license keys from the original receipt email or the portal.
- If the email address changed, contact BTSS Support with proof of purchase to transfer ownership.
