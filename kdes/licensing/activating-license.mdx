## Before You Start

- Purchase a license through the BTSS store or retrieve your key from the email receipt.
- Make sure Koala Studio is signed in with the same Koala account you used for the purchase.

## Activation Steps

1. Open Koala Studio.
2. Click your profile avatar → **License**.
3. Paste your license key (e.g., `KOALA-XXXX-XXXX`).
4. Click **Activate**. Koala validates the key and unlocks paid features immediately.

## Troubleshooting

- **Key already in use** – deactivate it from another machine via the license portal first.
- **Expired key** – renew via the store; Koala applies the renewal instantly after purchase.
