## Trial Period

- Koala Studio’s free tier lets you evaluate the native app without a purchase.
- Paid licenses follow the same policy as the VS Code extension.

## Refunds

- Within 14 days of purchase, contact BTSS Support with your order number to request a refund.
- Refunds are processed via the original payment method.
- Seats obtained through enterprise agreements follow the master contract terms—contact your account manager.

## Cancellations

- Subscriptions renew automatically. Cancel anytime via the customer portal to stop future charges.
- After cancellation, your license remains active until the end of the current billing period.

## Need Help?
