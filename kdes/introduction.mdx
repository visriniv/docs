## Meet the Native App

Koala Data Explorer Studio (KDES) is the Electron-based desktop companion to the VS Code extension. It delivers the same Oracle Fusion OTBI capabilities in a self-contained macOS, Windows, and optional Linux experience, complete with hardened IPC boundaries and Supabase-backed services.

- Ships as signed DMG/EXE installers produced through Electron Forge.
- Shares SOAP/OTBI client code with the extension but adds desktop-specific features such as multi-window controls and native menus.
- Targets analysts, consultants, and enterprise users who need richer clipboard/file access or cannot install VS Code.

## Why Add a Studio Section?

- We now have a **native** packaging option alongside the VS Code extension.
- Customers need parallel documentation that mirrors the structure of the existing extension docs.
- KDEE content must remain untouched; the Studio pages simply live next to it inside Mintlify.

Use this section to orient readers before they dive into setup, authentication, and usage guides specific to the native app.
