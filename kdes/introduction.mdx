## Meet Koala Data Explorer Studio

Koala Data Explorer Studio (KDES) brings the familiar Koala SQL experience to a stand-alone desktop app for macOS, Windows, and (optionally) Linux. It’s built for analysts, consultants, and developers who want Koala without running VS Code.

### What you can do

- Run Oracle Fusion OTBI queries with semicolon-scoped execution and per-tab connections.
- Keep an unlimited SQL history, export results to CSV/XLSX, and copy cells or rows instantly.
- Switch between the full Monaco editor or the lightweight Simple SQL mode depending on your task.
- Store data locally for offline access while keeping credentials encrypted in the cloud.
- Receive in-app update banners so you always know when a signed build is ready.

## How Studio Fits Next to the Extension

- KDEE (the VS Code extension) stays exactly as it is for teams that live inside VS Code.
- KDES offers the same query engine and Supabase backend but packages everything into a native installer with its own menus, shortcuts, and system integrations.
- Both products share features and connection schemas, so you can move between them without re-learning workflows.

Use the Studio pages in this tab whenever you need install instructions, user workflows, or troubleshooting steps that are specific to the native app.
