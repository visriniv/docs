## What is Koala Data Explorer Studio?

Koala Data Explorer Studio (KDES) is the native desktop edition of Koala. It delivers the same Oracle Fusion OTBI power as the VS Code extension but in a stand-alone macOS and Windows app with its own installer, menus, and update flow.

- Ships as signed DMG/EXE/AppImage installers with native menus, window controls, and OS integrations.
- Includes Monaco-powered editing, multi-tab workflows, saved queries, SQL history, CSV/XLSX export, and copy helpers.
- Stores results locally for offline review while credentials stay encrypted in Supabase.

## Why Koala Studio?

### Native Convenience
Launch Koala like any other application—no VS Code dependency, no extension updates to manage.

### Enterprise Friendly
Give analysts and consultants a self-contained tool that respects OS security controls, supports SSO, and works in locked-down environments.

### Seamless Switching
Connections, query history, and features mirror the extension, so teams can move between KDEE and KDES without relearning anything.
