## Meet Koala Data Explorer Studio

Koala Data Explorer Studio (KDES) brings the familiar Koala SQL experience to a stand-alone desktop app for macOS, Windows, and (optionally) Linux. It’s built for analysts, consultants, and developers who want Koala without running VS Code.

### What you can do

- Run Oracle Fusion OTBI queries with semicolon-scoped execution and per-tab connections (see `README.md` “Key Features”).
- Keep unlimited SQL history and access saved queries, CSV/XLSX export, and clipboard-safe copy workflows (`docs/query-results-table-copy-functionality.md`).
- Switch between the full Monaco editor and the lightweight Simple SQL mode (`docs/SIMPLE_SQL_EDITOR.md`) depending on the job.
- Store data locally for offline access while credentials stay encrypted in Supabase (`docs/FILE_STORAGE_GUIDE.md`).
- Receive in-app update banners and restart directly into the latest signed release (`docs/IN_APP_UPDATE_PLAN.md`).

## How Studio Fits Next to the Extension

- KDEE (the VS Code extension) stays exactly as it is for teams that live inside VS Code.
- KDES offers the same query engine and Supabase backend but packages everything into a native installer with its own menus, shortcuts, and system integrations.
- Both products share features and connection schemas, so you can move between them without re-learning workflows.

Use the Studio pages in this tab whenever you need install instructions, user workflows, or troubleshooting steps that are specific to the native app.
