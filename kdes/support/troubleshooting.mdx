## Quick Checks

- **App won’t start:** make sure you’re running the latest installer and that antivirus tools haven’t quarantined Koala. Reboot if an update just finished.
- **Can’t sign in:** confirm you can reach koala.btss.dev in a browser. If you recently reset your Koala password, sign out (profile menu) and sign back in.
- **SSO window doesn’t appear (Windows):** install or repair the Microsoft WebView2 runtime, then retry.

## Connection or Query Issues

- Re-enter credentials or import a fresh `.kdex` file if your connection list looks empty.
- If a query hangs, cancel it from the toolbar, adjust your SQL, and rerun. Clearing old result folders (see Storage page) can free disk space for large exports.
- Switch to Simple SQL mode when you suspect a tab-specific state issue; if the problem goes away, close and reopen the affected tab in the main editor.

## Update Problems

- If the banner keeps reappearing after a restart, download the latest installer manually and reinstall over your current build.
- Still seeing the previous version number under **About Koala Studio**? Contact support with the version listed plus the date of your last successful update.

## Talk to Support

- [Open a Freshdesk ticket](https://btsscorp.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/new) and include logs/screenshot if possible.
- Enterprise customers can also reach their BTSS account manager for priority help.

When Support requests additional data (logs, storage folders, etc.), they’ll guide you through exporting only what’s needed.
