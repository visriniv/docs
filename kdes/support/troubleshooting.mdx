## Diagnostic Playbook

- **Logs:** use `Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Option+I` for renderer logs; check terminal output for main-process traces.
- **SSO issues:** verify WebView2 runtime presence; run with `ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING=1` to capture helper output.
- **Storage corruption:** review `tabs/metadata/` and `tabs/session/session.json` as described in `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md`.

## Common Issues

- Connection/authentication failures – confirm Supabase session, re-import `.kdex` if metadata is stale.
- Query performance – rely on infinite scroll storage strategies to keep memory stable; clean up old result directories if disk is full.
- Update banner loops – ensure BTSS update endpoint hosts the latest manifests and installers per the Updates guide.

## Getting Help

- Internal teams: reference `Common.md`, `SETUP_AUTHENTICATION.md`, and `SECURITY_ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md` for compliance answers.
- Customers: use the Mintlify Support links (Freshdesk) or escalate via account managers.
