title: "KDEE ↔ KDES Sync Roadmap"
description: "How the extension and native app will share connections"
---

Koala Studio and the VS Code extension use the same connection model, so we’re rolling out cross-product sync in stages.

## Today – Encrypted Exchange Files

- Export connections from either app at any time.
- Choose a passphrase to protect the `.kdex` file, then import it on the other side.
- Works even in air-gapped environments because no extra service is required.

## Coming Soon – Automatic Cloud Sync

- We’re extending the existing Supabase backend to the extension.
- Once available, adding or editing a connection in one surface updates the other automatically.
- Conflicts are resolved per-connection, and you’ll see audit info for recent changes.

## Later – Enterprise Sync API (Optional)

- Large customers will be able to point both apps at a managed Koala sync gateway for extra audit, policy, or approval workflows.

## What You Should Do Now

- Use `.kdex` exports/imports whenever you need to move connections between KDEE and KDES.
- Watch release notes for the Supabase sync announcement; no extra setup will be required beyond signing in.
