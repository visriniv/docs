title: "KDEE ↔ KDES Sync Roadmap"
description: "How the extension and native app will share connections"
---

## Phase 1 – Encrypted Exchange Files

- Export/import commands on both apps produce `.kdex` files.
- User supplies a passphrase -> PBKDF2 derives an AES-256-GCM key.
- Air-gapped friendly; no shared infrastructure required.

## Phase 2 – Shared Supabase Backend

- Shared npm package (`@koala/connection-core`) defines models + encryption helpers.
- KDEE authenticates against Supabase to sync metadata/secrets just like KDES.
- Real-time conflict resolution plus activity logs.

## Phase 3 – API Gateway (Optional)

- Dedicated sync service decouples clients from Supabase.
- Adds enterprise controls: auditing, fine-grained scopes, and integration hooks.

## Why It Matters

- KDEE and KDES must coexist; users expect seamless connection portability.
- Mintlify should link to this roadmap so customers know cross-surface sync is actively managed.
- Until a shared backend ships, `.kdex` exports remain the supported method.

See `docs/connection-sync-approaches.md` for the underlying analysis.
