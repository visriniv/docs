## Viewing Connections

- Open the **Connections** drawer from the left rail or press `Ctrl/Cmd+,`.
- Use the search bar to filter by name or server.
- Icons indicate the auth type (Basic, OAuth PKCE, Windows SSO).

## Editing or Duplicating

1. Hover a connection and click **···**.
2. Choose **Edit** to change names, servers, or credentials.
3. Use **Duplicate** when you need the same settings but with a different schema or environment.

## Export / Import (`.kdex`)

- **Export**: click **···** → **Export connections**. Choose a passphrase to encrypt the `.kdex` file.
- **Import**: click **Import**, select the `.kdex`, and provide the passphrase. Existing connections update if the IDs match; new ones are added automatically.
- Use exports to share configurations between Koala Studio and the VS Code extension.

## Deleting

- Click **Delete** from the **···** menu. Koala asks for confirmation and removes both the metadata and any stored credentials.
- Deleting a connection removes it from all tabs; open tabs prompt you to choose another connection.

## Tips

- Keep production and sandbox environments clearly labeled.
- Periodically export your list as a backup—files are encrypted, so it’s safe to store them in password managers or secure drives.
