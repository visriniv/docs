## Signing In

1. Launch Koala Studio.
2. Sign in with the same Koala account you use for the VS Code extension (email OTP or SSO).
3. Once signed in, your saved connections appear automatically and stay tied to your Koala account.

## Connection Types

- **Basic:** supply your Oracle Fusion username and password. Koala encrypts them before they leave your device.
- **OAuth PKCE:** enter the client ID plus the authorization and token URLs provided by your Oracle admin.
- **Windows SSO:** (Windows only) click **Use Windows Login** to open a trusted Microsoft WebView2 window, then complete your organization’s SSO flow.

Each connection can include a friendly name, description, and default schema to keep your list organized.

## How We Protect Credentials

- Secrets are encrypted and stored in Koala’s secure cloud tables—never as plain text on disk.
- Only lightweight metadata (connection name, server URL, description) is cached locally so tabs load quickly.
- When you remove a connection, it disappears from every machine tied to your account.

## Managing Connections in Tabs

- Select a connection from the drop-down at the top of each tab.
- Switch connections at any time—the editor keeps query text intact even if you point the tab to a different environment.
- Use the overflow menu to duplicate tabs, rename them, or open the same connection in Simple SQL mode.

This experience mirrors KDEE so you can move between the extension and the native app without relearning anything.
