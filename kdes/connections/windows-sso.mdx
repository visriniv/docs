## Overview

On Windows, Koala Studio bundles the Koala SSO Helper (WebView2) to launch a native Oracle login window. Use this option when your organization enforces Integrated Windows Authentication or other SSO providers that rely on Windows credentials.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or 11 with the Microsoft WebView2 runtime installed (bundled with Koala, but corporate devices may remove it—reinstall from Microsoft if needed).
- Network access to the Oracle SSO endpoint.
- Koala Studio version 1.0.0 or later.

## Connecting with Windows SSO

1. Go to **Connections** → **Add Connection** → **Windows SSO**.
2. Fill in the basic connection details (name, server URL, optional description/schema).
3. Click **Sign in with Windows**.
4. A branded Windows login window appears. Complete the MFA/SSO prompts required by your org.
5. When the window closes, Koala saves the resulting token securely and tests the connection automatically.

## Token Renewals

- Tokens expire per your IdP policy. Koala notifies you to reauthenticate when needed.
- Switching Windows users on the same machine may invalidate the stored token, so sign in again if queries fail.

## Troubleshooting

- **SSO window never appears** – install/reinstall WebView2 and restart Koala Studio.
- **Stuck loading screen** – ensure the Oracle SSO URL is reachable (VPN, proxy, firewall).
- **“Token expired” errors** – re-open the connection, click **Sign in with Windows**, and finish the flow again.
