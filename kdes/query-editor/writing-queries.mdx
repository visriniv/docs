## Editor Essentials

- Monaco provides syntax highlighting for Oracle SQL, auto-indentation, bracket matching, and error underlining.
- Use snippets and multi-caret editing (`Alt+Click` on Windows, `Option+Click` on macOS) to modify repeated clauses.
- The minimap on the right helps you navigate large statements quickly; click it to jump to sections.

## Templates & History

- Click the history icon to insert any recently executed query into the current tab.

## Organizing Scripts

- Separate multiple statements with semicolons. Koala’s semicolon-scoped runner figures out which statement to run based on cursor position.
- Add comments (`-- inline` or `/* block */`)—they’re ignored during execution and stored with history for context.

## Formatting

- Press `Alt+F` (Option+F on macOS) to format the current statement using Koala’s formatter.
- Adjust formatting preferences (uppercase keywords, indentation style) under **Settings → Editor**.
