Koala Studio mirrors most KDEE shortcuts so you can move between products without relearning habits. Platform-specific modifiers adjust automatically (Ctrl on Windows, Cmd on macOS).

## Core Actions

- `Ctrl/Cmd+N` – New query tab
- `Ctrl/Cmd+O` – Open SQL file
- `Ctrl/Cmd+S` – Save SQL to a `.sql` file
- `Ctrl/Cmd+W` – Close current tab

## Running & Viewing Queries

- `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter` – Run selection/current statement
- `Shift+Enter` – Run but keep focus in the editor
- `Ctrl/Cmd+J` – Toggle results panel visibility
- `Alt+F` (Option+F) – Format SQL
- `Ctrl/Cmd+P` – Open Profile/Settings page
- `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+H` – Open Query History

Use these shortcuts along with standard Monaco commands (find, replace, multi-caret) to stay in flow while working in the native app.
