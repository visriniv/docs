## Why Use Bind Variables

- Prevents SQL injection by separating parameters from the statement.
- Speeds up repeated executions because Oracle can reuse execution plans.

## Syntax

Use `:variableName` inside your SQL, e.g.:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM gl_balances
WHERE ledger_id = :ledger
  AND period_name = :period;
```

## Running with Prompts

1. Execute the query. Koala detects the bind variables and opens a prompt dialog.
2. Enter values for each variable. Koala remembers recent values per tab.
3. Click **Run** to execute with those values.

## Managing Bind Definitions

- Use the **Bind Variables** panel in the right rail to prefill defaults.
- Toggle “Remember values” if you want Koala to reuse them the next time.
- Clear stored values via the panel menu if you switch contexts.

## Tips

- Keep variable names descriptive (`:start_period` vs `:p1`).
- Combine with Saved Queries so teammates can run the same template and simply fill in the prompts.
