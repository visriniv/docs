## Run Commands

- **Ctrl/Cmd+Enter** – runs the highlighted selection or the statement around your cursor.
- **Shift+Enter** – runs the current statement but keeps focus in the editor.
- **Run button** – executes the active statement; click the dropdown arrow for “Run All”.
- **Stop button** – cancels long-running queries.

## Semicolon-Scoped Execution

Koala analyzes the SQL around your cursor:

- If you highlight text, only the selection runs.
- If there’s no selection, the statement between the nearest semicolons runs.
- Empty lines count as boundaries, matching the VS Code extension’s behavior.

## Safety Nets

- Koala warns you before running statements flagged as destructive (e.g., `DELETE` without `WHERE`) if Safety Mode is on.
- Large exports paginate automatically so you don’t freeze the UI.

## Viewing Progress

- The status bar shows “Running…” plus elapsed time.
- Results appear in the lower pane with tabs for Grid, JSON, and Messages (including Oracle warnings).
