## Editing Large Scripts

- Koala streams editor state to disk so massive scripts don’t block the UI.
- Use the tab history panel to split long scripts into separate tabs—duplicate the tab and delete unused sections.
- Enable the “Show minimap” option to navigate quickly.

## Running Heavy Statements

- Split statements with semicolons and run them one at a time to avoid hitting Oracle limits.
- Keep an eye on the elapsed time indicator; click **Stop** if it exceeds your org’s timeout policy.

## Result Management

- Results are paginated in 1,000-row chunks stored under `tabs/results/<tabId>/`.
- Use the pagination controls to fetch additional pages only when needed, reducing memory use.
- Exporting to CSV/XLSX streams data to disk, so you can export millions of rows without freezing the UI (disk space permitting).

## Tips

- Close unused tabs to free memory—Koala persists their contents, so you can reopen them later.
- For scheduled jobs, save the SQL to a `.sql` file via the editor’s **Save As** option and store it in version control.
