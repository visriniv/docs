## Default Locations

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Koala Data Studio/`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/Koala Data Studio/`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Koala Data Studio/`

Use these paths if you ever need to back up your tabs or clear space.

## What’s Inside

```
Koala Data Studio/
├─ tabs/metadata/      # tab names, layouts, connection choices
├─ tabs/results/<tab>/ # paginated query results (1000 rows per file)
├─ tabs/session/       # which tabs were open last time
├─ temp/               # autosave files + recent exports
└─ auth/               # encrypted tokens tied to your Koala login
```

## Managing Disk Usage

- Delete old `tabs/results/<tabId>` folders if you need to reclaim space; the app will re-fetch results the next time you run the query.
- Leave `tabs/metadata` and `tabs/session` intact unless Support asks you to reset them—removing them clears tab layouts.
- Temporary files older than a week are cleaned up automatically, but you can safely empty the `temp` folder at any time.

## Privacy & Security

- Credentials remain encrypted and cannot be read directly from disk.
- Query results are plain JSON, so treat the storage folder as sensitive information.
- Pair Koala with OS-level protections such as FileVault or BitLocker for extra assurance.
