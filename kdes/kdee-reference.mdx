## Why Capture KDEE?

Koala Data Explorer Extension (KDEE) remains the first-class VS Code experience and the baseline customers already know. Documenting its capabilities alongside KDES helps stakeholders see continuity and understand why both surfaces now exist.

## Extension Highlights

- **Editor Surface:** Monaco-based SQL editor hosted within VS Code with IntelliSense, multiple tabs, and bind variable helpers (`/koala/editor/*` pages).
- **Connections:** Built-in workflows for Basic, OAuth PKCE, and Windows SSO using VS Code SecretStorage plus globalState metadata (`/koala/connections/*`).
- **Results:** Interactive grid with sorting, filtering, CSV/Excel export, search-in-grid, and up to 500-row history in paid mode (`/koala/results/*`).
- **Advanced Tools:** Data sources explorer, SQL history management, performance monitor, and multi-tab layouts (`/koala/advanced/*`).
- **Configuration & Licensing:** Extension-specific settings, timeout tuning, logging controls, and licensing flows documented under `/koala/config/*` and `/koala/licensing/*`.

## Update & Distribution Story

- Distributed exclusively via the VS Code Marketplace.
- Auto-updates handled by VS Code; no standalone installer management required.
- Release cadence mirrors quarterly branch/tag strategy, but the marketplace entry handles delivery.

## When to Stay on KDEE

- Teams already standardized on VS Code.
- Environments where installing native apps is restricted but extensions are allowed.
- Workflows that depend on other VS Code extensions side-by-side with Koala (linting, Git integrations, etc.).

## Linking the Two

- Use this snapshot page whenever KDES docs reference “extension parity” to reassure users that nothing was removed.
- Encourage readers to consult the existing KDEE pages (left navigation) for the full deep dives; this page simply summarizes “how KDEE was” before the native app arrived.
