## Creating a Koala Account

Unlike the VS Code extension (which relies on VS Code’s own identity and SecretStorage), Koala Studio requires a Koala Cloud account. If you’re new to Koala:

1. Launch Koala Studio and click **Create account** on the sign-in screen.
2. Enter your work email and click **Send code**.
3. Check your inbox for a one-time verification code (OTP) and enter it in Koala.
4. Choose a display name and accept the terms. Your account is ready immediately.

> Already using the VS Code extension? Sign in with that same email—no extra setup required.

## Staying Signed In

- Koala stores a secure cloud session token on your device, so you don’t need to sign in every time.
- If you switch machines, just sign in once per device; each one maintains its own session.
- Use **Profile → Sign out** only when you need to revoke access (e.g., shared computer).

## Password & OTP Reset

- On the sign-in screen, click **Forgot password?** (available if your org uses password-based login).
- Koala emails a one-time code. Enter it to set a new password securely.
- For OTP-only tenants, simply request a new verification code whenever you need to sign in—no static password required.

## MFA / SSO Notes

- Organizations using SSO (OAuth PKCE or Windows SSO) control login policies centrally. Koala follows whatever MFA/OTP rules your IdP enforces.
- If your account is locked or you don’t receive OTP emails, contact your identity admin or BTSS Support to unblock the user.
