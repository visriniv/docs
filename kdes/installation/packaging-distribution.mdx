> Customers do not need these steps. The signed installers referenced on the Download page are already produced by the Koala team.

## Local Packaging

- `npm run package` – bundles renderer, main, and preload for smoke tests.
- `npm run make` – runs Electron Forge makers to produce installers:
  - macOS DMG in `out/`
  - Windows Squirrel install set in `out/make/squirrel.windows/`
  - Optional Linux `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage`

## Code Signing Inputs

- **macOS:** Apple Developer ID credentials (API key or Apple ID + app-specific password) for codesign + notarization.
- **Windows:** either a PFX file referenced via `WIN_CSC_LINK`/`WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, a certificate common name (`WIN_CERT_SUBJECT_NAME`), or raw `WIN_SIGN_PARAMS`.

## Update Manifests

Each release must also emit:

- Windows `RELEASES` + `.nupkg`
- macOS `latest-mac.yml` + notarized `.zip`/`.dmg`
- Linux AppImage update JSON (if distributing AppImage)

These feeds power the in-app banner described in the **Updates & Releases** page.

## Publishing Checklist

1. Upload installers + manifests to the BTSS distribution endpoint.
2. Publish release notes consumed by the “View release notes” CTA.
3. Tag `master` per the quarterly convention (`vYYYY.Qx`) so CI/CD jobs run.
