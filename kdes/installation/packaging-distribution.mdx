## Local Packaging

- `npm run package` – bundles renderer, main, and preload for smoke testing without producing installers.
- `npm run make` – runs Electron Forge makers to output platform installers:
  - macOS DMG in `out/`
  - Windows Squirrel installer under `out/make/squirrel.windows/`
  - Optional Linux `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.AppImage`

## Code Signing

- macOS: supply Apple Developer ID credentials or app-specific password; notarized artifacts end up in `out/`.
- Windows: configure Authenticode signing using a PFX (`WIN_CSC_LINK`) or certificate subject name.

## In-App Updates

Package generation should also emit:

- Windows `RELEASES` + `.nupkg`
- macOS `latest-mac.yml` + `.zip`/`.dmg`
- Linux AppImage update manifests (optional)

These feeds power the in-app update banner described in the Updates section.

## Distribution Checklist

1. Upload signed installers + manifests to the BTSS distribution endpoint (S3 or corporate site).
2. Publish release notes JSON/Markdown for the “View release notes” CTA.
3. Tag releases per the quarterly branch strategy (`vYYYY.Qx`).

This mirrors KDEE’s release rigor while accounting for desktop-specific assets.
