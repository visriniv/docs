## Step 1 – Sign In

1. Open Koala Studio.
2. Sign in with your Koala Cloud account (email OTP or SSO, depending on your tenant). If you previously used only the VS Code extension, create a Koala account first—the extension itself does not require one.

## Step 2 – Launch the Connection Drawer

1. Click **Connections** in the left rail or use `Ctrl/Cmd+,`.
2. Choose **Add Connection**.

## Step 3 – Choose the Auth Method

- **Basic Auth:** supply the Oracle Fusion username/password.
- **OAuth PKCE:** enter client ID, auth/token endpoints, and redirect URI (matches your org settings).
- **Windows SSO:** available on Windows when the WebView2 helper is installed—launches a native window to capture your JWT.

## Step 4 – Save & Test

1. Provide a friendly name and optional description so you can recognize the connection later.
2. Click **Test Connection** to validate credentials.
3. Save; the connection now appears in the tab selector and is synced to Koala Cloud so other machines can reuse it.

## Step 5 – Run Your First Query

1. Open a new tab (Ctrl/Cmd+N).
2. Pick the connection you just created.
3. Paste or type your SQL and press `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter`.
4. Inspect results, export to CSV/XLSX, or copy cells/rows as needed.

Your connection metadata remains available the next time you open Koala Studio, and it can be exported to KDEE via encrypted `.kdex` files when needed.
