> Most customers can skip this page and install the signed builds instead. Use these steps only if you're contributing to the desktop app or need to run a custom build.

## 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

This installs Vite, Electron Forge, the Koala cloud SDKs, and shared Oracle SOAP helpers.

## 2. Configure Environment Variables

- Create `.env` for local work and `.env.production` for CI.
- Required keys: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
- Optional flags: feature gates, logging toggles, or update endpoints.

## 3. Start the Dev App

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command spins up:

- Vite renderer dev server
- Main/preload watchers
- Electron running against the Vite outputs with hot reload

## 4. Debugging Tips

- Renderer DevTools: `Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Option+I`
- Main process logs: view the terminal session
- SSO helper tracing: run with `ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING=1`

You now have a contributor-grade environment without relying on VS Code as a host.
