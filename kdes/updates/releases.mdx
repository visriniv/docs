## How Updates Work

1. Koala checks for updates when you launch the app and every few hours after that.
2. When a new build is ready, a slim banner appears at the top of the window.
3. Click **Restart & Update** to install immediately, or choose **Later** to dismiss the prompt until the next reminder.

The download happens quietly in the background. You’ll only see a fallback link if your network blocks the update service.

## Manual Installers

Prefer to download yourself? Grab the newest DMG/EXE/AppImage from the Koala download portal and install over your existing version. Your settings and connections stay intact.

## Release Cadence

- New builds typically ship at the end of each quarterly development cycle.
- Critical fixes may appear between quarters—you’ll see the same banner for those releases.
- Release notes link directly from the banner so you can preview changes before restarting.

## Checking Your Version

1. Click your profile avatar.
2. Choose **About Koala Studio**.
3. The modal lists the current version plus the date it was installed.
