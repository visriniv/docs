## Branch & Tag Model

- Quarterly branches (`2025_A`, `2025_B`, etc.) feed into `master`.
- At quarter end, merge into `master`, tag `vYYYY.Qx` (or semantic version), and trigger release workflows.

## CI/CD

- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds signed installers for macOS + Windows upon tag push.
- Secrets required: Supabase creds, Apple signing values, Windows signing settings.
- Azure DevOps mirror runs `yarn make` on both platforms, signs artifacts, and publishes to BTSS hosting.

## In-App Update Banner

As documented in `docs/IN_APP_UPDATE_PLAN.md`:

1. `autoUpdater.checkForUpdates()` runs on launch and every 4 hours.
2. Renderer shows a slim banner: “New Koala Data Explorer update is ready.” with `Restart & Update` / `Later`.
3. Downloads happen silently; errors swap the CTA to “Retry download” and link to manual installers.

## Release Assets

- Windows: `RELEASES` + `.nupkg`
- macOS: `latest-mac.yml` + notarized `.zip`/`.dmg`
- Linux (optional): `.AppImage` + update JSON

Document these steps so Ops/Docs teams can keep Studio releases at parity with the VS Code extension.
