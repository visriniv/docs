## How Updates Work

- BTSS publishes new macOS and Windows installers at the end of each quarterly development cycle (and occasionally for hotfixes).
- Download the latest build from the [Koala portal](https://www.btsscorp.com/koala-data-explorer/) and install it over your existing version—no uninstall required.
- Your connections, tabs, and settings remain intact after reinstalling.

## Staying Informed

- Follow release notes in the Koala portal or your license email for announcements.
- If Support shares a hotfix build, install it the same way (download → run the DMG/MSI).

## Checking Your Version

1. Click your profile avatar.
2. Choose **About Koala Studio**.
3. The modal lists the current version plus the date it was installed so you can confirm you’re on the newest build.
