## Result Cache

- Configure how many result sets Koala keeps in memory before writing to disk.
- Lower the value on low-RAM machines; raise it if you switch between recent queries frequently.

## Grid Rendering

- Toggle virtualization (on by default) to improve scrolling through large result sets.
- Disable animations if you prefer instant row rendering.

## Auto-Cleanup

- Set how often Koala clears the `temp/` directory and stale tab results (default: 7 days).
- Run **Clean now** to reclaim disk space immediately.

## Hardware Acceleration

- On Windows, you can disable GPU acceleration if you encounter driver issues.
- Restart Koala after toggling this option for it to take effect.
