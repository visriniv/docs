## Viewing Logs

- Open Settings → **Logging & Diagnostics** or use the profile menu → **View Logs**.
- Renderer logs include editor events, query status, and UI actions.
- Main-process logs capture auto-updates, file-system operations, and SSO helper events.

## Log Levels

- **Normal** – default; logs warnings and errors.
- **Verbose** – adds info-level messages useful when working with Support.
- **Debug** – only enable when Support requests it; may include extra network details.

## Exporting Logs

1. Go to **Settings → Logging & Diagnostics**.
2. Click **Export logs**.
3. Choose a destination; Koala zips recent logs for easy sharing with BTSS Support.

## Additional Diagnostics

- Enable **Telemetry** (if your org allows it) to help BTSS monitor crash/update rates.
- Toggle **Capture network traces** when troubleshooting SSO or Supabase connectivity; Koala stores the trace alongside logs and clears it after export.
