## Accessing Settings

1. Click your profile avatar → **Settings**.
2. Use the left sidebar to switch between categories (General, Editor, Downloads, Updates).
3. Changes save automatically; some require restarting Koala.

## General

- **Theme** – follow system, force light, or force dark.
- **Start-up** – reopen last session or start with a blank window.
- **Downloads folder** – choose where exports and logs are saved.

## Editor

- Toggle minimap, line numbers, and word wrap.
- Choose preferred font size and family (Monaco defaults).
- Enable/disable “Warn on destructive statements” safety prompts.

## Updates

- View your current version number and release notes.
- Use the quick link to open the Koala download portal when you’re ready to install the latest build manually.

## Resetting

- Use **Reset to defaults** at the bottom of each section to restore factory settings.
- Resetting does not affect your connections, history, or saved queries.
