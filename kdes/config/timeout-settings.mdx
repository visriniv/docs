## Why Adjust Timeouts?

Different environments have different SLAs. Some customers need aggressive cancellation to protect shared resources, while others need to allow long-running reports. Koala Studio lets you tune both app-side and Oracle request timeouts.

## Query Timeout

- Default: 5 minutes.
- Change under **Settings → Query Execution**.
- When the limit is reached, Koala cancels the request and shows a timeout error. Increase it if you routinely run heavy OTBI queries.

## Export Timeout

- Applies when exporting large result sets to CSV/XLSX.
- Default matches the query timeout; extend it if you export millions of rows.

## Idle Session Timeout

- Configure how long inactive tabs keep connections alive before Koala releases them.
- Lower values reduce load on Oracle but may require reconnecting when returning to a tab.

## Tips

- Coordinate with your Oracle administrators—app-side timeouts should be slightly below server-side ones so Koala handles the cancellation gracefully.
- If you consistently hit timeouts, consider refining your SQL or leveraging filters before exporting entire datasets.
