## Semicolon-Scoped Execution

- Runs the statement surrounding the cursor, including empty-line boundaries.
- Selection-first: highlighted SQL overrides automatic detection.
- Shortcut parity with KDEE: `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter` (run), `Alt+F` (format), `Ctrl/Cmd+N` (new tab).

## Monaco Tabs with Native Chrome

- Each tab stores its own connection, history, and editor state.
- Tab chrome adapts to native window controls (padding adjustments for macOS traffic lights).
- Saved queries and query history use the same Supabase backend as KDEE.

## Hardened IPC

- Renderer communicates with main/preload via whitelisted channels only.
- File dialogs, exports, and clipboard actions go through secure handlers to avoid arbitrary native access.

## Accessibility & Performance

- Fast-loading Monaco configuration (see `docs/monaco-editor-fast-loading.md`).
- Infinite scroll + pagination strategies prevent freezing on large result sets.
- Keyboard shortcuts and VS Code-like UX minimize relearning for KDEE users.
