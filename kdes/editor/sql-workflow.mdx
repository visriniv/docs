## Familiar Shortcuts

- `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter` runs the highlighted selection or the statement around your cursor.
- `Alt+F` formats SQL using Koala’s formatter.
- `Ctrl/Cmd+N` opens a new tab without losing the current editor content.

Everything behaves just like the VS Code extension, so you don’t lose muscle memory.

## Tabs That Remember Everything

- Each tab keeps its own connection, query text, and history.
- Rename tabs to highlight environments (e.g., “Prod GL”, “Test HCM”).
- Duplicate a tab when you want to tweak a query without losing the original.

## Editing Comforts

- Monaco editor powers IntelliSense, syntax highlighting, and multi-caret editing.
- Light/dark mode follows your OS preference, or choose manually from the profile menu.
- Autosave protects unsent queries if the app closes unexpectedly.

## Performance When Results Get Large

- Koala streams results so you can scroll through thousands of rows without freezing the UI.
- Jump between tabs instantly—each one reloads only the data you need.
- Use the right-rail history to rerun recent statements with a single click.
