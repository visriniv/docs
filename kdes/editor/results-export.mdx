## Grid Interactions

- Built on Material React Table with native copy helpers (`enableClickToCopy`).
- Inline search, sorting, and pagination mirror KDEE behavior but with native window chrome.

## Export Options

- CSV and XLSX exports leverage the same pipelines as the extension.
- Large result sets stream to disk in chunks (1000 rows per page) before packaging.

## CSV Viewer

- Dedicated CSV parsing components (Papa Parse) let users upload files, inspect data, and re-export without leaving the app.
- Accessible from the profile dropdown; supports sorting, filtering, pagination, and copy/export actions.

## Reference Material

- `docs/query-results-table-copy-functionality.md`
- `README.md` CSV parsing section
- `docs/FILE_STORAGE_GUIDE.md` for where exported files live

Document these workflows in Mintlify so users see parity with the VS Code experience plus the extra CSV tooling unique to the native app.
