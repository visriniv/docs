## Explore the Grid

- Click any column header to sort ascending/descending.
- Use the in-grid search box to filter rows without re-running the query.
- Hover over a cell to reveal the copy icon, or press `Ctrl/Cmd+C` to copy the current selection.

## Export Options

- **CSV or Excel:** choose the format from the toolbar. Koala streams data in chunks so even very large result sets export reliably.
- **Copy Table:** copy the visible page to paste into chat, email, or spreadsheets.
- **Pagination Controls:** move between result pages (1,000 rows each) without fetching the query again.

## Built-in CSV Viewer

- Open **CSV Viewer** from the profile menu to inspect any CSV you drag in—great for quick validations or sharing snippets with teammates.
- Apply the same filters, column toggles, and export actions without needing Excel.

## Where Files Are Saved

- Exports go to your OS download location by default.
- Temporary files live inside the Koala storage directory and are cleaned up automatically every few days (see the Storage page if you need to clear space manually).
