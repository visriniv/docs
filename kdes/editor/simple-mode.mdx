## When to Use It

- You only need to paste a query, pick a connection, and see results.
- Monaco feels heavy on low-powered machines or when troubleshooting.
- You prefer a clean interface for training or read-only access.

## What You Get

- A single editor pane with a connection dropdown and Run button.
- Query history and execution timing so you can re-run statements quickly.
- Clear error messaging plus the same keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter`.

## What Stays Behind

- No multi-tab layout, saved queries, or file operations.
- Syntax highlighting/autocomplete are trimmed to keep the view lightweight.

## How to Open It

1. Click your profile avatar in the top-right corner.
2. Choose **Open Simple SQL Mode**.
3. The view opens in a new window so you can keep the full editor running elsewhere if needed.

Simple mode uses the same connections and history as the primary editor, so you can switch back and forth without any migration.
