## Why Simple Mode Exists

- Provides a clean textarea + results table for users who do not need full Monaco tooling.
- Reduces bundle size and eliminates complex tab/state logic—ideal for troubleshooting.

## Features Included

- Connection selector shared with the main editor.
- Query history logging + execution timing.
- Error messaging and basic keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl/Cmd+Enter` to run).

## What’s Omitted

- Tab management, saved queries, advanced Monaco features, and file operations.
- Syntax highlighting/autocomplete (keeps dependencies minimal).

## Accessing the Route

- Navigate to `/simple-sql` inside the app or open via the profile dropdown.
- Uses the same SOAP execution pipeline as the main editor, so results and history stay in sync.

See `docs/SIMPLE_SQL_EDITOR.md` for implementation specifics if you need to extend the feature.
